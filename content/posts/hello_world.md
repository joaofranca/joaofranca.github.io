No new programming experience is complete without the classic "Hello World" output. In this case, this post marks the *upgrade* my personal website just went through. 

These were the most noticeable changes:
* Instead of [Jekkyl](https://jekyllrb.com/), I'm now using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework to create/generate the site (the theme is [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)) - the reason being Hugo is more powerful feature wise, allowing me to easily add more nice things.
* Speaking of nice things, the posts (aka blog) is one of those.
* The site now also has an awesome search feature using [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) (it comes by default with the PaperMod theme).
* By the way, posts and content support suggestions (via GitHub issues and PRs), you can check the "Suggest Changes" link under the subtitle for this post, as an example.
* I kept the particles animation that gives the home page a nice touch. Though it would be fun to code something similar, I used [this already cool one](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js).

This is pretty much it, I'll see you around!
